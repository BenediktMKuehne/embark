the worker is a host with a defined ssh port open

ssh login is possible through keybased authcand shall not impinge normal operations

further we need the configuration of sudo for emba to be executed correctly with a username optional password


- IP
- PORT
- USERNAME
- EMBA-dir location
- EMBA-report location (ssh-mounted)
- optional PASSWORD
- public ssh key from embark host for auth


? 2 seperate users for EMBArk www and emba runners?
